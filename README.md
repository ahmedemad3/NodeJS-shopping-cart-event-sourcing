# Event Sourcing Shopping Cart Application

This Node.js project with TypeScript demonstrates an implementation of event sourcing for a shopping cart with a PostgreSQL database.

## 1st Chronological Reductions with TypeScript

## 2nd Denormalization Technique

In the context of this project, denormalization refers to the process of simplifying data retrieval by storing redundant copies of certain information. It is particularly useful when dealing with read-heavy workloads, as it optimizes query performance at the expense of some redundancy in the data.

### Denormalized Table

A denormalized table is used to aggregate and store cart-related events, making it easier and faster to query the current state of a shopping cart. The denormalized table is designed to reduce the need for complex joins and calculations when retrieving cart information.

### Benefits

1. **Improved Query Performance**: Denormalization reduces the need for joins and aggregations during read operations, leading to faster query execution.

2. **Simplified Query Logic**: With denormalized data, the query logic becomes simpler, as the necessary information is readily available in a single table.

3. **Efficient Retrieval of Latest State**: The chronological reduction process is facilitated by the denormalized table, enabling efficient retrieval of the latest state of a shopping cart.

### Considerations

While denormalization offers performance benefits for read operations, it comes with the trade-off of increased storage space and the need for careful management to keep redundant data consistent.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src`: TypeScript source code.
  - `controller`: Contains the controllers for handling HTTP requests.
  - `service`: Contains the business logic or services.
  - `repository`: Contains the data access logic or repositories.
  - `model`: Contains the data models or entities.
  - `router`: Contains the routers for defining API endpoints.
  - Other supporting files and folders.

- `dist`: Compiled JavaScript code (generated after TypeScript compilation).

- `db-scripts`: Database scripts for setting up the PostgreSQL database.

- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.

- `package.json`: Node.js package configuration file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedemad3/NodeJS-shopping-cart-event-sourcing.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shopping-cart
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Compile TypeScript code:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will start, and you can access the API at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### Add Cart Event

- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/cart/:customerId/events`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "eventType": "ADD_TO_CART",
    "eventDate": "2023-11-19T12:30:00Z",
    "itemId": 123,
    "itemName": "Example Item",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 19.99
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Status code `201` (Created)

### Get Customer Cart with Aggregations

- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/cart/aggregation/:customerId`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** Customer's cart with aggregations.

### Get Customer Cart

- **Endpoint:** `/api/v1/cart/:customerId`
- **Method:** GET
- **Response:** Customer's cart.

...

Feel free to explore these APIs and adapt them based on your specific needs.

## Database Scripts

In the `db-scripts` directory, you'll find the following scripts:

- `update_cart_item_fn.sql`: SQL script to update cart items function.
- `db-create.sql`: SQL script to create necessary database tables.

Ensure that you execute the scripts in the specified order for the correct setup of the database tables and functions.

...

Feel free to adapt the script names and content based on your specific database setup and requirements.

## Notes

- This is a basic example, and you may need to customize the logic based on your business rules and requirements.
